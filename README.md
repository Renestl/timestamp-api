### Technologies Used

NodeJS

###### Objectives
Build a Heroku app that is functionally similar to this: https://timestamp-ms.herokuapp.com/.

###### User Stories
* I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016)
* If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
* If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
